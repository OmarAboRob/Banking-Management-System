# Demo Banking-Management-System
A banking management system is a software application used by banks and financial 
institutions to manage and automate their daily operations. This can include tasks such as 
account management, online banking, transaction processing, loan management, and 
reporting. These systems can also be integrated with other financial systems, such as 
credit card processing and fraud detection. The goal of a banking management system is 
to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and provide better service to customers.
